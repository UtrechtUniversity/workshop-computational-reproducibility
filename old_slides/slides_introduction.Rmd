# General guidelines (and advice!)
- Ask for help when you need it! 
  - You can ask a question in the Teams chat.
     - We will try to answer it directly.
  - Indicate you are stuck in the Status Chart ([tinyurl.com/repcochart](https://tinyurl.com/repcochart))
     - We will invite you to a 1:1 call in a Helper channel.

--

- Please mute yourself when you are not speaking (we are strict and will mute you without warning)

--

- We appreciate your video, but only share if you are comfortable.

--

- Close as many unnecessary windows and programs as possible.

--

- Take a computer break when we take a break: a timer will show when we return!

# Being reproducible
![example](images/screenshots/badexample.png)

---
# Is this enough?

- Access to the code
- Access to the data
- (And let's assume we can replicate the enviroment)

How confident do you feel?
--

> This code is a kludgly, ugly, inefficient mess. 
(...)
>  It is probably riddled with problems, mistakes, bugs, inefficiencies, vestigial code stubs, etc etc.
(...)
> I am as confident as I am capable of being that all of the factual claims that were made in the manuscript are accurate.

--

We need to do more: we need to inspire trust.
- The code is correct (and I have made it easy for you/someone to check);
- My workflow is robust;
- My workflow *itself* is accessible, and I will be guiding you through it.

# The Four Facets of Reproducibility

.pull-left-medium[
#### Documentation
What do you need to execute this project? Where do you start?

#### Organization
Demonstrate a trustworthy workflow.

#### Automation
Automated analyses trace your steps, and prevent human error (or at the very least: document it).

#### Dissemination
Share your data, release your code, publish your findings.]

# What will we do in this workshop?

We will take you through a workflow (in a broad sense!)

--

- Setting up a project

- Establishing a robust backup / version control system

- Writing good code

- Writing documentation

- Making your project accessible

--

We will end by trying to reproduce each others' projects!



---
# What do we expect from you?

- Our group has many different abilities and experiences. We hope you will value this as much as we do!

- We have done our best to make the workshop asynchronous so you can work at your own pace.

- However, we have incorporated several moments for shared discussion and questions. Use them!

- Feel free and safe to share your expertise and experiences.

#### Our objectives for you
We want to teach you **good habits** that will make your work more accessible, trustworthy, and reproducible by others. In doing so, we have tried to identify those habits that are a **good return on investment**: meaning, they save you time in the not-so-long run.

### And finally: we hope you enjoy the workshop
