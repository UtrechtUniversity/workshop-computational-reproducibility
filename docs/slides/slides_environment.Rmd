# Congratulations!

You now have a project!
- Your project structure is accessible
- Your code is readable and invites re-use
- The project is under version control
- It has a landing page on Github, with information for a user

Are you done?

#### It depends...

# Dependencies

Dependencies and versions can stop your users/readers from being able to run your code.

For example: this code written in Python 2.7:
```{python, eval=F, error=TRUE}
print "Hello world!"
```
```{python,echo=F}
print("Hello world!")
```


No longer works in Python 3!
```{python, eval=F, error=TRUE}
print "Hello world!"
```
```
  File "/var/folders/96/r1yycxlj28958p1cdynhbyzw0000gn/T/Rtmpa0OGSM/chunk-code-b08d2b78904b.txt", line 1
    print "Hello world!"
                       ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print("Hello world!")?
```

Instead, we write:
```{python}
print("Hello world!")
```

# The reproducibility trade-off

How far do you go towards reproducibility?

![](images/dependencytradeoff.svg)


- **due diligence** starts at declaring dependencies.

- You can empower your declared dependencies with a package/environment manager such as `conda`.

- packaging dependencies uses tools like [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) (for R), or [pipenv](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/managing-dependencies/) (for Python).

- containers are awesome, and container tools like Docker and Singularity probably sound more daunting than they actually are.

- online environments can be created for your work (in a relatively user friendly way):
  - [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com) (`$$$`)
  - [binder](https://mybinder.org/) (free!)

# Our advice

#### Are you working with Python?
- Use `conda` and declare your dependencies in an `environment.yml` file.

#### Are you working with R?
- Use `renv` and package your dependencies in a lockfile.


_In the next slides we will elaborate on some other options as well, but honestly, just do this._

# Declaring dependencies

#### OK: declare (in your README) how your project works **for you**.
  - What language, what version?
  - What packages/libraries do you load
  - What OS do you use? (Does it work on your collaborator's system?)

#### Better: prepare a file for a package manager:
- **what?** A single file describing the necessary dependencies, which can be used to install all dependencies in one step
- **where?** Store the file in the repository root (main folder)
- **which?** This depends on the environment/package manager you want to use:
  - For `conda` (python and R): generate an `environment.yml` file
  - For `pip` (python only): generate a `requirements.txt` file
  - *NB: you can use both, if you need `pip` for the installation of any specific dependency!*

---
# Declaring dependencies: conda

#### `environment.yml` (for conda)
- Used by `conda` to create an environment populated by specific packages and languages.

```
name: example_env
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python>=3.10
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - pandas
```
- Go through your scripts and check the import statements and add necessary packages to the `environment.yml` file.
- Use `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create a conda environment from file.
- Consider going through [this quick intro](https://geohackweek.github.io/Introductory/01-conda-tutorial/)  to `conda` environments.
- Generate it with `conda env export -f environment.yml`

---

# Declaring dependencies: pip

#### `requirements.txt` (for pip)
- Used by `pip` to install packages

```
###### Requirements without Version Specifiers ######
pandas
beautifulsoup4
matplotlib

###### Requirements with Version Specifiers ######
torch == 2.0.0              # Version Matching. Must be version 2.0.0
keyring >= 4.1.1            # Minimum version 4.1.1
coverage != 3.5             # Version Exclusion. Anything except version 3.5
Mopidy-Dirble ~= 1.1        # Compatible release. Same as >= 1.1, == 1.*

```
- Go through your scripts and check the import statements and add necessary packages to the `requirements.txt` file.
- Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all packages from file.
- Generate it with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- [Here is an example](https://github.com/Curly-Mo/musinformatics/blob/552494f8e6aec9810b1027e725bbf24a6784b369/requirements.txt). Search for [more on GitHub](https://github.com/search?p=3&q=filename%3Arequirements.txt&type=Code).

# Packaging dependencies

.pull-left[
#### In R: `renv`
Install with:
```r
install.packages("renv")
```
Activate with:
```r
renv::init()
```
Update with:
```r
renv::snapshot()
```
Load the contents of a lockfile with:
```r
renv::restore()
```
[Read more here.](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/11/06/renv-project-environments-for-r/)
]

.pull-right[
#### In Python: `pipenv`

[Follow this brief tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/managing-dependencies/) to set up `pipenv` for your project.

# Your turn!

1. Add basic dependency information to your readme file:
  - What version of your language is required?
  - Which packages does a user need to load before running your project?
  - Can you provide installation instructions?
  
1. Are you working with Python?
  - Create a conda or pip requirements file for your project in the root
  - check your scripts for the imported libraries and add them to the file.
  
1. Are you working with R?
  - Install `renv`, and initiate it to store the lock file in root.
  
1. Be sure again to update your git repository:
   ```bash
   git add [your changed files]
   git commit -m "the change you made"
   git push
   ```
