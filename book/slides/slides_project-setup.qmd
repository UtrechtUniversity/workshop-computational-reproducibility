# Setting up a project {data-background-color="#FFCD00"}

## Research compendium

::: {.theme-section}

> A research compendium is a collection of *all digital parts of a research project* including data, code, texts (...). The collection is created in such a way that reproducing all results is straightforward.

## Getting started

::: {.theme-section}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}

- Contain your project in a single recognizable folder

* Distinguish folder _types_, name them accordingly:
    + **Read-only**: data, metadata
    + **Human-generated**: code, paper, documentation
    + **Project-generated**: clean data, figures, models...

* Initialize a **README** file, document your project

* Choose a **license**

* Publish your project.

## Simple Project Templates

::: {.theme-section}

You can set up a project template using one of the following template repositories of a project folder structure to your computer:

  - **R:** [https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/simple-r-project](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/simple-r-project)
  
  - **Python:** [https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/simple-python-template/](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/simple-python-template/)

Simple click through _Use this template_ -> _Create a repository_ and enter the necessary information for your new repository such as the name and owner.

## Absolute vs. Relative Paths

::: {.theme-section}

* Your project should be transportable between computers.

* For this reason, you should use **relative paths** only: compare
    + `/Users/barbara/Dropbox/proteindomains/data/zincfinger.json`
    + `./data/zincfinger.json`

* `./` means: in this folder

* `../` means: one folder up

:::

## Your turn

::: {.theme-section}

* Clone one of the following template repositories of a project folder structure to your computer:

    + **R:** [https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/simple-r-project](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/simple-r-project)
  
    + **Python:** [https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/simple-python-template/](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/simple-python-template/)

* Place your project files in the right folder.

* Adjust paths in your code, and be sure to use relative (see next slide) paths! 

* It is fine to have the main script (e.g. `main.py`) in the home folder!

## Choosing a license

::: {.theme-section}

- Copyright is implicit; others cannot use your code without your permission.

- Licensing gives that permission, and its boundaries and conditions.

- Choosing a license early on means being aware of your license as the project proceeds (and not creating conflicts).

- There are over [80 OSI-approved licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) (and [many](http://dbad-license.org), [many](http://www.wtfpl.net) others) to choose from.

This is one I like to use:

What is important to you? What does your lab use? [Choose your own license!](http://choosealicense.com)

## Publishing your project

::: {.theme-section}

Uh... Isn't 'publication' the thing you do... _at the end?_ 

::: {.fragment}

No! Publishing your project at an early stage
- forces you to consider readability throughout
- minimizes the mess you have to deal with when you (finally) decide to publish
- allows collaboration and support
- facilitates sharing and re-use.

:::

::: {.fragment}

_But what if someone scoops my code! I'm a revolutionary, they will steal my ideas!_

:::

::: {.fragment}

If you are super paranoid, you can always opt for a private repository. It is your work & up to you. But consider the advantages!
:::
:::

## Publishing unpublished data

::: {.theme-section}

* If you have sensitive data...

    + Don't include your data in your software repository (that's not what they are for anyway).
    + Consider generating simulated data so your code can run regardless.

* And for all data:

    + Your data should be separate from your code!
    + If your code references your data, consider a config or metadata file for these references.

## Where do I publish?

::: {.theme-section}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=70%}

### Living project: github
(or other social coding platform):

- synergistic with version control software git

- makes history public and accessible _(eek!)_

- allows publication of different releases

- provides a platform for interaction and collaboration

### Archiving a release: zenodo
(or other stable repository, like the [OSF](https://vickysteeves.gitlab.io/2018-uutah-repro/the-open-science-framework.html))
- [direct archiving supported](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) from github to zenodo

- this gives you a **doi** (digital object identifier): your code is citeable!
