# Setting up a project {data-background-color="#FFCD00"}

## Research compendium

::: {.theme-section}

> A research compendium is a collection of *all digital parts of a research project* including data, code, texts (...). The collection is created in such a way that reproducing all results is straightforward.

## Getting started

::: {.theme-section}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}

- Contain your project in a single recognizable folder

* Distinguish folder _types_, name them accordingly:
    + **Read-only**: data, metadata
    + **Human-generated**: code, paper, documentation
    + **Project-generated**: clean data, figures, models...

* Initialize a **README** file, document your project

* Choose a **license**

* Publish your project.

## Licenses

::: {.theme-section}

- Copyright is implicit; others cannot use your code without your permission.

- Licensing gives that permission, and its boundaries and conditions.

- Choosing a license early on means being aware of your license as the project proceeds (and not creating conflicts).

- There are over [80 OSI-approved licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) (and [many](http://dbad-license.org), [many](http://www.wtfpl.net) others) to choose from.

We will dive into licenses in the Software Publication chapter.

## Public or Private?

::: {.theme-section}

When creating a GitHub repository for your code you need to decide to make it publicly accessible or to keep it private.

::: {.fragment}

Publishing your project at an early stage
- Consider readability throughout
- Get feedback during development from your community
- May generate collaborations
- Makes it easier to create a Publication or a software package

--> Open Science

:::

::: {.fragment}

_But what if someone scoops my code! I'm a revolutionary, they will steal my ideas!_

:::

::: {.fragment}

You can always opt for a private repository.

## Data

::: {.theme-section}

**How to include large, sensitive data or unpublished data?**

* Don't include your data in your software repository.
* Include simulated data or a small example dataset to test your code.

* Research Data and full datasets:

    + Your data should be separate from your code!
    + Provide instructions where to store the data with respect to the software
    + Provide a configuration file where users define where data is stored.
    + Make software callable with different data paths. (No absolute paths!)
