# Reusability {data-background-color="#FFCD00"}

## Code reusability

::: {.theme-section}

- **Reusable code**: Code that can be used again in the same project or in other future projects.

- Code needs to be **modular**.

- Benefit: Less code to write means less code to update and lower chance of human errors

:::

## Code reusability: some guidelines

::: {.theme-section}

- **Separate code and data**: data is specific, code need not be

  - consider using a config file for project-specific (meta)data
  - but DO hard-code unchanging variables, e.g. `gravity = 9.80665`, **once**.

- **Do One Thing** (and do it well)

  - One function for one purpose
  - One class for one purpose
  - One script for one purpose (no copy-pasting to recycle it!)

- **Don't Repeat Yourself**: use functions

 - Write routines in functions, i.e., code you reuse often
 - Identify potential functions by action: functions perform tasks (e.g. sorting, plotting, saving a file, transform data...)
 
:::

## Code reusability through functions

::: {.theme-section}
Functions are smaller code units responsible for one task.

- Functions are meant to be reused

- Functions accept arguments (though they may also be empty!)

- What arguments a function accept is defined by its parameters


:::

## Example:
::: {.theme-section}

- Repeated code

```r
indexATG = [n for n,i in enumerate(myList) if i == 'ATG']
indexAAG = [n for n,i in enumerate(myList) if i == 'AAG']
```

- Reusing a function

```r
def indexString(inputList,z):
	zIndex = [n for n,i in enumerate(li) if i == z]
	return zIndex
	
indexATG = indexString(myList,'ATG')
indexAAG = indexString(myList,'AAG')
```
\
Functions do not necessarily make code shorter (at first)!

:::

## Think in building blocks!

::: {.theme-section}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}
Small, cohesive units are much better than...

::: {.column width="10%"}

::: {.column width="60%"}
... a customized behemoth!

## Example

::: {.theme-section}

**`script.py`**

```python 

def main(filename, output_dir):
    df = read_input(filename)
    df = preprocess(df)
    x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test = prepare_data_ml(df)
    result = train_model(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)
    save_result(result, output_dir)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(args.filename, args.output_dir)

```
<br>
<br>
<br>

```bash
python script.py --filename data/iris.csv --output_dir results
```

## Your turn: visualize your code!

::: {.theme-section}
Choose:

- Make a screenshot, process it in paint, powerpoint, or your favorite editor;
- Copy paste your code to a text editor, and use markers.

The objective is for you to 'see' your code!

- Yellow denotes scripted, unstructured code _(basic, sequential lines of instructions)_
   
- Purple denotes functions or other structured code _(e.g. for-loops, conditionals, etc.)_

- Green denotes comments (or comment blocks)
   _(consider combining this with yellow for heavily commented code)_

Again, make notes in your code (`#TODO`!) if you see:

- **Scripted code**: this can be a function
<!-- - **Structured code**: this should be re-structured  -->

What can you learn from your colleagues today?

:::

## Your turn: make a function

::: {.theme-section}
You have visualized your code. Use your findings to improve it!

- **Preferably**: take scripted code and turn it into a function, _or_ split an existing function into two or more functions.

- If there is no function to work on: try and address the readability of your code.

_However_: for future exercises you will need at least one function, preferably with parameters, in your code! For example:

```python
def my_function(param_a, param_b):
  if param_b == 99:
    return None
  
  if param_a == 100:
    do_something(param_a)
  else:
    do_something_else(param_a)
```
