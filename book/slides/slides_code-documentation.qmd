# Documentation {data-background-color="#FFCD00"}

## Why do you need documentation?
::: {.theme-section}
:::

- You want yourself to understand how code written some time ago works
- You want others to understand how to (re-)use your code

**For this you need to**

- Explain parts of your code with __comments__
- Explain what to install and how to get started in your __readme__
- Explain in-depth use of your code in a __notebook__

## Comments
::: {.theme-section}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

**Comments are annotations you write directly in the code source.**

They:

- are written for users who deal with your source code

- explain parts that are not intuitive from the code itself

- **do not** replace readable or structured code

- (in a specific structure) can be used to directly generate documentation for users.

## When **not** to use comments

::: {.theme-section}

- ...to repeat in natural language what is written in your code

```r
# Now we check if the age of a patient is greater than 18
if(agePatient > 18)

```

- ...to turn old code into zombie code (fine for troubleshooting, but do not leave it in!)

```r
# Do not run this!!
# itDoesNotWork <- optimizeMulticoreDeepLearning(myProteins)
# if(itDoesNotWork == 1444){
#    connection <- connectToHPC(currentUser, password)
#}
```

- ...to replace version control, like git

```r
# removed on August 5
# if() ...

#Now, it connects to the API with o-auth2, updated 05/05/2016
...
```

## Comment lines: WHY over HOW

::: {.theme-section}


Comment lines are used to explain the **purpose** of some piece of code.

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}
:::

```python
# Bug fix GH 20601
# If the data frame is too big, the number of unique index combination
# will cause int32 overflow on windows environments.
# We want to check and raise an error before this happens

num_rows = np.max([index_level.size for index_level in self.new_index_levels])
num_columns = self.removed_level.
```

## Docstrings
::: {.theme-section}

- Structured comments, associated to *segments* (rather than lines) of code, can be used to generate documentation for users*  of your project.

- These comments are called *docstrings*.

- Docstrings are parsed as the first statement of a module (e.g. a function or class).

- Docstrings allow you to provide documentation to a function, that is relevant to the user of that function.

- Writing docstrings makes you generate your documentation as you are generating the code: efficiently, comprehensively!

## Generating docstrings

::: {.theme-section}


In R you will need a separate package to deal with docstrings:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 1em"}

```r
library(docstring)

multiply <- function(x,y){
#' @title Multiply two numbers
#' @description This function takes two
#' input numbers and multiplies
#' them. It returns the multiplied result.
#' @param x The first value
#' @param y The second value
#' @return The two arguments multiplied.

  return(x*y)
}

?multiply
```

## Generating docstrings

::: {.theme-section}

In Python, docstrings are string literal comments following a function declaration:


```python
def multiply(x,y):
  """
  Multiply two numbers
  
  This function takes two input numbers and multiplies them.
  It returns the multiplied result.

  Parameters
  ----------
  x : int or float
      the first value
  y : int or float
      the second value

  Returns
  -------
  int or float
      result of multiplication
  """
  return x*y
```

NB: a triple single quote (`'''`) works, but PEP style prefers double quotes for docstrings.

## A glimpse into code generation

::: {.theme-section}

Docstrings are formatted so that they can easily be turned into documentation of your package.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}
You will need additional tools:

  * http://www.doxygen.nl/ : C++ (and many more languages)
  * http://www.sphinx-doc.org/ : Python
  * https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/ : R

We will not do this today, but it is worth checking out if you want to release your code!

:::
:::
::: {.column width="5%"}
:::
::: {.column width="55%"}
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}
In the console, in RStudio, run the following command:

```R
roxygen2::roxygenise()
```

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 1em"}
:::

The command above will create documentation files that can be visualized by calling help(your package)

## Your turn (choose one!)
::: {.theme-section}

**Comment lines**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0.5em"}

- Do you have superfluous comments? **Remove them!**
   + Remove your zombie code and version control-like comments
   +See if you can replace a 'how' comment for a 'why' comment (_what is the purpose of this code?_ rather than _this is how this code works_)
:::
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0.5em"}
- Are there elements without comments that need them? **Add them!**
  + Have you found yourself staring at a piece of code for too long without understanding it? Perhaps it needs more information!
  + Try to comment on the thought behind the code rather than phrasing it in English.
:::

::::

**Docstrings**

- Add a docstring to a function, preferably the last function you worked on (so it's fresh in your memory).
- Keep in mind: what does my user need to know when they are working with this function?
