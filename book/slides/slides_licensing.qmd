# Licensing {data-background-color="#FFCD00"}
## Choosing a license 
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

- Copyright is implicit; others cannot use your code without your permission.

- Licensing gives that permission, and its boundaries and conditions.

- Choosing a license early on means being aware of your license as the project proceeds (and not creating conflicts).

- There are over [80 OSI-approved licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) (and [many](http://dbad-license.org), [many](http://www.wtfpl.net) others) to choose from.

This is one I like to use:

What is important to you? What does your lab use? [Choose your own license!](http://choosealicense.com)

## Publishing your project?{.scrollable }

Uh... Isn't 'publication' the thing you do... _at the end?

No! Publishing your project at an early stage

  - forces you to consider readability throughout
  - minimizes the mess you have to deal with when you (finally) decide to publish
  - allows collaboration and support
  - facilitates sharing and re-use.

But what if someone scoops my code! I'm a revolutionary, they will steal my ideas!_

  - If you are super paranoid, you can always opt for a private repository. It is your work & up to you. But consider the advantages!

## Publishing unpublished data

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

- If you have sensitive data...

  - Don't include your data in your software repository (that's not what they are for anyway).
  - Consider generating simulated data so your code can run regardless.

- And for all data:

  - Your data should be separate from your code!
  - If your code references your data, consider a config or metadata file for these references.

## Where do I publish?

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

### Living project: github

(or other social coding platform):

- synergistic with version control software git

- makes history public and accessible _(eek!)_

- allows publication of different releases

- provides a platform for interaction and collaboration

### Archiving a release: zenodo
(or other stable repository, like the [OSF](https://vickysteeves.gitlab.io/2018-uutah-repro/the-open-science-framework.html))

- [direct archiving supported](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) from github to zenodo

- this gives you a **doi** (digital object identifier): your code is citeable!
