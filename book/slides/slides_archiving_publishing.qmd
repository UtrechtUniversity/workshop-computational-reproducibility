# Archiving and Publication {data-background-color="#FFCD00"}

## Let's think about the future... {.scrollable }
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}
::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}


- Will this repository still be here in five years? 



- #### Will my account? 



- ### Will GitHub?

## Archiving the project

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}
:::::::::::::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}
Zenodo has a sandbox environment!

- Not the main data repository, but still functional.

- You will get an *actual* DOI, and your project will (probably?) not be deleted!

- Only do this following exercise if you are OK with your code staying online!

- You will not be able to do this with a private repository.


Zenodo and Github have a pipeline that makes your life easier! (_Check the full how-to [on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content#issuing-a-persistent-identifier-for-your-repository-with-zenodo)._)


#### Your turn:


- Go to: [sandbox.zenodo.org](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/), and log in with GitHub. (If you do not have GitHub, simply sign up for a zenodo account; some of the coming steps you will need to do manually...)
- GitHub will then ask permission to give Zenodo access; click "Authorize application".

## Select your repository

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211021121037if_/https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/zenodo-toggle-on.png){ width="90%" height="600" fig-align="center"}

Click on your enabled repository. This will take you to a page with a green GitHub button. With this button you can create a realease for your publication.

:::

## Release your project!

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 1em"}
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211026201828if_/https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/repo-view.png){ width="60%" fig-align="center" height="500"}

... and follow the workflow!

(Unsure about version number? Wait a slide! :-)

:::

## Semantic versioning

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

A version has three numbers: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- MAJOR version denotes changes that alter the compatibility (i.e. someone using your functions may need to change their use for their code to still work),
- MINOR version adds functionality, but remains compatible
- PATCH version makes (compatible) bug fixes.

(If your bug fix changes compatibility, it is therefore a MAJOR version change!)


**You can release today with v0.1.0**
:::

## Check zenodo

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

Your code is now uploading to Zenodo: you can check it under the 'upload' tab:

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211026201828if_/https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/upload-tab.png){ width="70%" height="600" fig-align="center"}

## Getting your DOI

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

- Add some final descriptions
- Click 'publish'
- Voilá!

## Getting your DOI


::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}
Do you know your DOI?
<br><br>

As a final touch (only with real Zenodo!): you can take your DOI and place it as a badge at the top of your README.
<br><br>


```bash
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/YOUR.DOI.svg)](http://dx.doi.org/YOUR.DOI)
```

<br><br>



__This is not recommended with a Sandbox DOI, because sandbox projects are not permanent.__
__The Sandbox DOI will not work like a normal one does!__

## Are you ready? {.scrollable }
::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
**Let's exchange projects!**

Please go to the second tab in the status chart [tinyurl.com/repcochart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J3SfR2C0cghVjUPGCjk9UXZzipB3c7HL5Z1iicK8adc/edit#gid=600881461), and fill out:

- your project name
- your project (github) URL
- your name
- the language in which the project was written

in the yellow columns.


NB this information will be deleted right after the course

:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
**Now, write your name in one of the blue columns behind a project you will reproduce.**


We hope that everyone's repository will get a reproduction-attempt, so only add your name to the second column if there are no repos left (for you)!

:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}

**As you reproduce, please give your colleague feedback!**

Open an issue in your colleague's GitHub repository and copy/paste this [feedback template](../feedback-on-reproducing-projects.txt)
