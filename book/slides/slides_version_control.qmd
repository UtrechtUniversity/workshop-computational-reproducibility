## Why do we need to keep track of versions?

::: {.theme-section}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}

- "It broke … hopefully I have a working version somewhere?"
- "Can you please send me the latest version?"
- "Where is the latest version?"
- "Which version are you using?"
- "Which version have the authors used in the paper I am trying to reproduce?"
- "Found a bug! Since when was it there?"
- "I am sure it used to work. When did it change?"
- "My laptop is gone. Is my thesis now gone?"

## Popular automated version control systems

::: {.theme-section}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

- GitHub
- GitLab
- Codeberg
- BitBucket

They have different webinterfaces but all work with git.

**This tutorial uses GitHub.**

## Browse an existing project

::: {.theme-section}

We will start easy!

::: {.callout-note}

- See a real Git repository and understand what is inside of it.
- Understand how version control allows advanced inspection of a repository.
- See how Git allows multiple people to collaborate relatively easily.
- See the big picture instead of remembering a bunch of commands.

## Exercises

::: {.theme-section}

Explore the Web interface!

1. How many changes did the Guacamole recipe receive?
2. Which recipes include the ingredient "salt"?
3. Who modified each line last and when?
4. Are you allowed to use these recipes yourself? Are you allowed to publish modifications to these recipes?
5. Browse issues and pull requests in the repository

**Summary**

- Git allowed us to understand the development of this simple project much better than we could, if it was just a few files on our own computer.
- It was easy for us to access the project (hence easy to share our work with others).

In the next section we will create our own Git repository!

## Creating a Code repository
::: {.theme-section}

Git knows two ways of creating an own Git repository.

1. If you like to have a copy of an existing Git repository that someone else created, you create an own copy by "forking" the repository. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. You can create your own GitHub code repository. Simply go to your account and click on the green button "New" under "Your Repositories"

**Simple repository templates provided by Utrecht University**

- Python developers: https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/simple-python-template
- R developers: https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/simple-r-project

:::

## A word on "Commits"
::: {.theme-section}

- The commit titles are shown in the history of the repository. 
- The title and the message will help us later to understand what we updated and why we updated the code base.
- [Commit message conventions](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- [Commit messages in practice](https://latenightcommits.com/)

Now that you have started to customise your new GitHub repository, let’s have a look whether we can do that in a bit more convenient way, directly on your computer instead of through the web browser.

:::

## Working with your repository on your laptop
::: {.theme-section}

![](../images/github_figures_screenshots/git_create_repo.svg){width=55% fig-align="center"}

- Clone: Create a local copy
- Pull: Fetch changes in the remote repo
- Push: Update remote repo with local changes

:::

## Update the remote GitHub repository
::: {.theme-section}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}


![](../images/github_figures_screenshots/git_workflow.svg){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}

- Open the README file
- Change the contents of the README file and save
- Check the status `git status`
- Prepare to send it off
	- `git add README.md`
	- `git commit -m "Change the README file"`

:::
::::
:::

## Pushing to GitHub
::: {.theme-section}

You can now push the content of your local repository to the one on GitHub:

```
git push
```

Congrats, you have made your first push and your scripts are online!

![](https://octodex.github.com/images/original.png){width=200} \\\_\_\_ _THANK YOU!_

Take a look at your online repository. 
- Who is the author of your commits? 
- If it is not you, you can configure git to use your identity (make sure GitHub knows this email address):

<br>

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

:::

## Update the local repository
::: {.theme-section}

- Assume you changed your remote repository through the browser
	- How do you update your local repository?

- Make another change to your README file in the web browser of GitHub.
- Now go back to your terminal and do:

```
git status
git pull
```
:::

## The .gitignore file
::: {.theme-section}
- Located in your local repository `.gitignore`
- Lists files and folder which Git should ignore: They are **NOT** uploaded to GitHub	
- E.g. .DS_Store
:::

## Exercises

::: {.theme-section}

- After moving files into your local repository on your computer, run git status to see what Git thinks has changed.


Please note: are there (temporary) files you do not wish to track? Add them to the .gitignore file. Consider a .gitignore template for your language: examples on this github repo.

- Run git log to see the history of your project.

- Can you use Git and push to Github from your IDE?

- Experiment with editing and committing on GitHub itself (e.g. add something to the README file). You can then 'download' your changes to your local repository using git pull.

- Run git log again to see the history of your project.

- Optional: What happens if you edit the same file online and locally, and try to push/pull? (Hint: this often causes a 'merge conflict', which is no fun to experience. Going through it today means we can assist you if necessary!)

## Your turn: Useful git commands

::: {.theme-section}


```
git status
```

[Git status](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) shows you the status of your repository. It tells you which files are created, modified, or deleted relative to the last **git snapshot** (aka __commit__) of your project.

```
git diff
```

[Git diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) shows you the actual differences between the files that you have changed since the last snapshot.

```
git --help
```

This command will show you all the commands that you can use with git.
