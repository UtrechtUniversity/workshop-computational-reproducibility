## General guidelines (and advice!)

::: {.theme-section}

* Ask for help when you need it! 
    + Raise your hand
    + Use a sticky note
* Our helpers can help you with technical issues

* Take a computer break when we take a break!

## Being reproducible

![](../images/screenshots/badexample.png){width=75%}

## Is this enough? {.smaller}

::: {.theme-section}

- Access to the code
- Access to the data
- (And let's assume we can replicate the enviroment)

**How confident do you feel?**

> This code is a kludgly, ugly, inefficient mess. 
(...)
>  It is probably riddled with problems, mistakes, bugs, inefficiencies, vestigial code stubs, etc etc.
(...)
> I am as confident as I am capable of being that all of the factual claims that were made in the manuscript are accurate.

<br>

We need to do more: we need to inspire trust.

- The code is correct (and I have made it easy for you/someone to check);
- My workflow is robust;
- My workflow *itself* is accessible, and I will be guiding you through it.

## The Four Facets of Reproducibility

#### Documentation
What do you need to execute this project? Where do you start?

<br>

#### Dissemination
Share your data, release your code, publish your findings.

<br>

#### Automation

Automated analyses trace your steps, and prevent human error (or at the very least: document it).

<br>

#### Dissemination

Share your data, release your code, publish your findings.

## What will we do in this workshop?

::: {.theme-section}

We will take you through a workflow (in a broad sense!)

- Setting up a project
- Establishing a robust backup / version control system
- Writing good code
- Writing documentation
- Making your project accessible

<br>

### We will end by trying to reproduce each others' projects!

## What do we expect from you?

::: {.theme-section}

- Our group has many different abilities and experiences. We hope you will value this as much as we do!
- We have done our best to make the workshop asynchronous so you can work at your own pace.
- However, we have incorporated several moments for shared discussion and questions. Use them!
- Feel free and safe to share your expertise and experiences.

#### Our objectives for you
<br>
We want to teach you **good habits** that will make your work more accessible, trustworthy, and reproducible by others. In doing so, we have tried to identify those habits that are a **good return on investment**: meaning, they save you time in the not-so-long run.

<br>

#### And finally: we hope you enjoy the workshop
