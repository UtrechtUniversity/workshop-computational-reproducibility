### Exercise

* Use a linter to run through your code and identify style issues.

* Edit your code to improve the style compatibility, based on the feedback from your linter.
  If you work with Python, consider applying [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) to automatically fix linting issues.

* For the R users: a course participant found [styler](https://styler.r-lib.org/), which may do the same for R!

* If you find code that is hard to read, or variable names that need adjusting, make a note to work on it.
  (Again, use #TODO or another consistent label!)
