## R

If you're an R user, we ask you to ensure your installation of R & RStudio are up to date.

You can use the following links to upgrade your installation if required:

| Resource | Link |
|------|------|
|   R (v4.3.x)    |   [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/)   |
|   RStudio (v2023.09.x)  |   [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)   |

## Python

To ensure a smooth course, we ask you to check whether your Python installation is working correctly.

If you have installed Python using (ana)conda, verify your installation according to <https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/verify-install/>.

If you're using the regular Python installer, you can verify you installation by typing on the command prompt/command line:

```         
python --version
```

and

```         
pip --version
```

These should tell you which versions of python and pip are installed. For Python we recommend at least version 3.8.

If you have difficulties, we recommend installing Python using [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/).
