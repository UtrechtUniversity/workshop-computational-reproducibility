# Project Management

Reproducible coding starts with organizing your project and workflow in such a way that you, contributors and potential users can navigate easily through files, folders, changes and different versions of your project. A great tool that helps with this is a Version Control System. Git is now *the* standard for Version Control and we will use Git and GitHub (the most popular online platform for working with Git) throughout this course.
