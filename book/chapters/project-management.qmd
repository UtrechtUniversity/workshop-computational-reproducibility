# Project Management

This section covers the following topics:

* Setting up a folder structure

* Using git for version control

* Publishing your project on github

* Choosing a license

Time for some hands-on practice!

We have 3 short videos and accompanying exercises for you to go through one by one.
Watch the video first, then apply the exercises to your own project.
Use the [slides](../slides/slides_project-setup.html) linked above to follow links discussed in the video.
Be sure to ask for help when you need it!
