### Exercise

Visualize your code.

* Use yellow for scripted code, purple for structured code (for-loops, functions, etc.), and green for comments

* Use any tool that works for you (powerpoint, word, paint, or good old pencils and paper)

* During this exercise, try to identify yellow parts that can be structured and turned into (a) function(s). Label them, or rewrite them if you have time.
