### Exercise (optional)

**For R**

- Generate a file called `runtime.txt`, either in the root of your project, or in a (hidden) folder called `.binder/`.
- Write in the file: `r-2020-10-02` -- or specify the R version with `r-3.6-2020-10-02`.
- Write a file called `install.R`, in `.binder/` or in root, and use it to write install code for your packages, e.g.:
  ```
  install.packages("ggplot2")
  install.packages("dplyr")
  ```
- Binderise your project by following the instructions via [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/)

Binder automatically loads Python 3.6.

- Add dependencies to your binder in the requirements.txt file like this:
  ```
  numpy==1.14.5
  pandas==1.1.2
