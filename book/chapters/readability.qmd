### Exercise

* Run a _linter_ through your code and identify style issues:

    * **R:** [`lintr`](https://lintr.r-lib.org/)
    * **Python:** [`flake8`](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/)

* Edit your code to improve the style compatibility, based on the feedback from your linter.

* Run an _autoformatter_ through your code to automatically fix issues instead of simply flagging them: 

    * **R:** [`styler`](https://styler.r-lib.org/)
    * **Python:** [`black`](https://pypi.org/project/black/)

* If you find code that is hard to read, or variable names that need adjusting, make a note to work on it. Use #TODO or another consistent label so you can extract these notes later.
