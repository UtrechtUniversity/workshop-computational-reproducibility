# Accessibility & Reproducibility

In this last part, we will discuss how to make your work accessible and reproducible for others. Under what conditions can others use your work? How can you publish a version of your work in a way that other people can cite it and find it, even if it is in a few years from now? And lastly, how can you make sure that your work is reproducible, i.e. that others can rerun your analysis and get the same results?
