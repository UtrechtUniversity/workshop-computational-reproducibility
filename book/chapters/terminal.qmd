# Terminal

Some of the work we will do will take place over the command line, for which you will need a terminal.

-   Mac OS and Linux have easily accessible terminals (the program is usually called _Terminal_, so that's easy).

-   Windows' default terminal (Command Prompt) uses different commands, so we do not recommend it for this workshop. Instead, as you install Git (next sub-section), you can get the Git Bash terminal with your installation.

If you have no experience with the terminal at all, we recommend practicing with it for some basic folder navigation to start. [This 8.5 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6vKLJxAKfw) is a good introduction.
