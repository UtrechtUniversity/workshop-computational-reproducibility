### Exercise

* Add a docstring to a function, preferably the last function you worked on (so it's fresh in your memory).
  _Keep in mind: what does my user need to know when they are working with this function?_

* Grab a limited chunk of code to work on, and look at the existing comments.
  Can you replace a 'how' comment with a 'why' comment?
  _Think: what is the purpose of this code? Rather than: this is how this code works._

* Are there elements in your chunk that are currently without comments that would benefit from clarification? 
  _Try to comment on the thought behind the code rather than simply translating its process in English._

* Can you delete superfluous comments or zombie code?
    _If the code is clear enough without the comment, it's better to remove it._
