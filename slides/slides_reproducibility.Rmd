# Let's think about the future...

#### Will this repository still be here in five years? 

### Will my account? 

## Will GitHub?

# Archiving the project

![zenodo-part3](https://blog.zenodo.org/static/img/logos/zenodo-gradient-1000.png)

Zenodo has a sandbox environment!
- Not the main data repository, but still functional.
- You will get an *actual* DOI, and your project will (probably?) not be deleted!
- Only do this following exercise if you are OK with your code staying online!
- You will not be able to do this with a private repository.

Zenodo and Github have a pipeline that makes your life easier! (_Check the full how-to [on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)._)

#### Your turn:
- Go to: [sandbox.zenodo.org](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/), and log in with GitHub. (If you do not have GitHub, simply sign up for a zenodo account; some of the coming steps you will need to do manually...)
- GitHub will then ask permission to give Zenodo access; click "Authorize application".

# Select your repository


![toggle](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/zenodo-toggle-on.png)
---
# Release your project!


![release](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/repo-view.png)

... and follow the workflow!

(Unsure about version number? Wait a slide! :-))

---
# Semantic versioning

A version has three numbers: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- MAJOR version denotes changes that alter the compatibility (i.e. someone using your functions may need to change their use for their code to still work),
- MINOR version adds functionality, but remains compatible
- PATCH version makes (compatible) bug fixes.

(If your bug fix changes compatibility, it is therefore a MAJOR version change!)

#### You can release today with v0.1.0

# Check zenodo

Your code is now uploading to Zenodo: you can check it under the 'upload' tab:

![citable-upload](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/upload-tab.png)
---
# Getting your DOI

- Add some final descriptions
- Click 'publish'
- Voilá!

# Getting your DOI

Do you know your DOI?

As a final touch (only with real Zenodo!): you can take your DOI and place it as a badge at the top of your README.

```
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/YOUR.DOI.svg)](http://dx.doi.org/YOUR.DOI)
```

__This is not recommended with a Sandbox DOI, because sandbox projects are not permanent.__
__The Sandbox DOI will not work like a normal one does!__

# Are you ready?

#### Let's exchange projects!

Please go to [tinyurl.com/repco-share](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FlQnSj8ipbUNhZgr_nS1PHnaapL8SvamWcfPjKTaBhA/edit#gid=0), and fill out:
- your project name
- your project (github) URL
- your name
- the language in which the project was written

in the yellow columns.
--

#### Now, write your name in one of the blue columns behind a project you will reproduce.

We hope that everyone's repository will get a reproduction-attempt, so only add your name to the second column if there are no repos left (for you)!
--

#### As you reproduce, please give your colleague feedback!

Fill out the form at [tinyurl.com/repco-feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfH4mGicAAvDipysWM9AfcH0sQdd9L202atRLlQsXRGUJ3QAA/viewform)
